    <h4>Boracay Island Travel Tips</h4>
   
    <p>I visited the island last summer for the second time and I had the most amazing time ever! That's why I'm sharing with you some valuable tips if you ever want to visit Boracay anytime soon :)<br></p>
    <p>Any conversation about the Philippines as a tourist destination isn’t complete without a mention of Boracay. It is, after all, the country’s most well-known beach attraction, topping various publications’ lists of best islands in Asia and in the world. <br></p>
    
   <img src="images/boracay.png" alt="Boracay Island Image" class="boracayimg1">
    
    <p>It’s not difficult to understand Boracay’s appeal. You’ll see it immediately upon setting foot on the island. Aside from its sheer natural beauty, I have yet to see another destination that can match the island’s white sand — Boracay has something for everyone. Whether you’re a budget backpacker or a luxury traveler, young or old, solo or on a honeymoon, with friends or with family, you’ll find something to fall in love with here. <br>

    <p><b>Here are more bits about Boracay.</b></p>
    
    <section class="boracaylist-1">
    <ul>
        <li><b>Location:</b>    Boracay is within the municipality of Malay, province of Aklan in the Philippines. Mainland Aklan is part of Panay Island.
        </li>

        <li><b>Languages:</b>   Aklanon and Ati are the native languages. But locals, especially those working in the tourism industry, can fluently speak and understand Tagalog and English.
        </li>

        <li><b>Currency:</b>   Philippine peso (PHP, ₱). PHP100 is around USD 1.90, EUR 1.69, CAD 2.57 (as of May 2021).
        </li>

        <li><b>Modes of Payment:</b>   CASH, primarily. Some establishments accept credit cards, but bring cash to be safe.

    <h5>Where to Stay in Boracay?</h5>

    <p>When looking for a place to stay in Boracay, it is important to be familiar with its geography. Boracay is a bone-shaped island politically divided into three barangays (villages): Balabag, Manoc-Manoc, and Yapak. Manoc-Manoc is the southernmost barangay, where both jetties are located.<br></p>

        <img src="images/boracaystations.webp" alt="Boracay Image" class="boracayimg4">
    
    <p>Most people who haven’t been to Boracay are under the impression that it has only one beach because most media features focus on its main stretch — White Beach. And while it is the longest and most popular, it is not the only strip of sand here. The island is hemmed by over a dozen beaches! When looking for accommodations, it is important to consider not just the barangay but also the beach where it is located. Here are some of the beaches in Boracay.

        <br></p>
    
    <section class="boracaylist-2">
        <ul>
            <li><b>White Beach,</b> the busiest, most crowded, and arguably the most stunning beach on the island. This has the highest concentration of accommodations. It is also the longest beach, split into three stations. Stations 1 and 2 are located in Barangay Balabag, while most of Station 3 is in Manoc-Manoc. Many of the island’s key attractions like D’Mall, the grotto, and most popular restaurants can be found here. Station 1 is tucked on the northernmost end of the beach, which makes it relatively quiet. Stations 2 and 3 are where most shops and bars are located. Filling the island’s western coast, White Beach is also the best and most accessible place to watch Boracay’s glorious sunset.
                </li>
        
            <li><b>Bulabog Beach,</b>   another long stretch hugging the eastern side of the island. The sand here isn’t fine, but it is also very accessible and is most well-known as the jump off point for many exciting water activities.
            </li>
        
            <li><b>Diniwid Beach, </b>   is a short patch of sand north of White Beach’s Station 1, separated only by a promontory. Although seemingly isolated, there is a cemented walking trail along the beach that connects Diniwid to White Beach. You’ll also find a few resorts and hostels here.
            </li>   
           
        </ul>

        <p>Some higher-end resorts like <b>Shangri-la Boracay</b> and <b>Flora East</b> are located along smaller coves.
